  - View all available courses
  - Filter by country, level, field
  - Search functionality with text search
  - Featured courses section
  
- **Advanced Search**:
  - Real-time search results
  - Multiple filter combinations
  - Pagination support
  - Sort by various criteria

### 3. User Features

  - Monitor system activity

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Security**:
   - HTTP-only cookies for JWT
   - Password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Rate limiting on auth routes
   - Secure password reset flow

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Input sanitization
   - XSS protection
   - CORS configuration
   - MongoDB injection prevention

## API Structure

### Public Endpoints
```
GET    /api/courses            - List all courses
GET    /api/courses/featured   - Get featured courses
GET    /api/courses/:id        - Get course details
GET    /api/courses/search     - Search courses
```

### Protected User Endpoints
```
GET    /api/user/dashboard     - User dashboard data
GET    /api/user/bookmarks    - User's bookmarked courses
PUT    /api/user/profile      - Update user profile
POST   /api/user/bookmark/:id - Toggle course bookmark
```

### Admin Endpoints
```
GET    /api/admin/dashboard   - Admin dashboard data
POST   /api/admin/courses     - Create new course
PUT    /api/admin/courses/:id - Update course
DELETE /api/admin/courses/:id - Delete course
```

## Database Schema

### User Collection
- Basic information (name, email)
- Authentication details
- Bookmarked courses
- Profile data

### Course Collection
- Course details
- University information
- Application requirements
- Bookmark references

## State Management
The application uses React Context API for state management:

1. **Auth Context**:
   - User authentication state
   - Login/Logout functions
   - User profile data
   - Admin status

2. **Course Context**:
   - Course listing
   - Search filters
   - Pagination state
   - Bookmark status

## Performance Features

1. **Optimized Loading**:
   - Pagination for large lists
   - Lazy loading of images
   - Caching of frequent data
   - Optimized database queries

2. **User Experience**:
   - Loading indicators
   - Error boundaries
   - Toast notifications
   - Responsive design

## Error Handling

1. **Frontend Errors**:
   - Form validation
   - API error handling
   - Network error detection
   - Friendly error messages

2. **Backend Errors**:
   - Global error handler
   - Validation errors
   - Database error handling
   - Security error handling

## Getting Started

1. **User Registration**:
   - Visit `/register`
   - Fill in required information
   - Verify email (if enabled)
   - Complete profile

2. **Course Search**:

   - Access admin dashboard
   - Manage platform

## Best Practices
- All API calls include error handling
- Protected routes require authentication
- Input validation on both frontend and backend
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Regular security updates
- Performance monitoring
- User activity logging
